This section of the document enlists the over-all understanding about the project.

Reference Website - It should be similar to freelance.com but will target another kind of customers and freelancers.

The idea came from a big need in Algeria, Morocco and Egypte to find a good service provider, it is very hard to find a good construction worker or plumber or baby sitter..., that will be on time, respects the deadlines and does a great job. 
Every family in those countries have encountered a problem where they had to wait a coupe of months just to fix a small hole. 
so our project idea is to create an online service marketplace for both private and professional service providers, allowing them to get reviews, ranking and marks for users. 
The customers wil then be able to see their profolios and contact them through the website. They also be able to rate or recommend them after the end of the job.


This section of the document enlists the over-all understanding about the project.

1)	Create an online directory listing website where service providers (babysitters plumbers, gardners……….) can post their services on the website and service seekers can request their services by posting their requirements. 

2)	There will be three user roles in the website namely: Customer, Provider, and Admin of the website. 

3)	Without registration, users can visit the website and will see only the information which is publicly accessible. 

4)	Users will need to register on the website to post an ad and once the user logs into his account; he will have his own dashboard to manage his profile and ads. All the ads posted by the users will be approved by the admin and then posted on the website after verification. 

5)	Customers will have several options to work on the website : 

	They can search the providers by applying filters and results will be shown along with Google Map location display. Filters would be distance, location, proximity etc. 

	Customer can post his requirement by filling a form with details: category, description, date, duration, hourly rate (or ask for provider’s proposal), place. 

	Once the requirement is posted, customer can modify it as well. Relevant providers profiles are recommended by the system based on proximity. User can check the profile and request for service through messaging him. 

	Also, customer can recommend the service provider by providing rating and leaving message. This will add more to the provider’s profile as recommendation counts will be shown on his profile. 


6)	Providers will have several options on the website such as: 

	Provider can register to the website and post his services along with details of hourly rate, certifications and specializations, availability, video etc. 

	They can see their ads in the dashboard and manage their account. All the messages, services, contacts, and searches. A Google map location will be shown where the provider is located. 

	They can check their inbox if they are contacted by any customer


Project Specifications

	Providers can make recommendations to their friends and clients to join the system. 

	Profile visitors can like their profile through Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and share on LinkedIn. 



7)	Ratings, feedbacks and recommendation counts will be shown on the profile of user as service contractors and freelancers. 

8)	The website would be multilingual to work in French and Arabic. There will be drop-down menu on front-end of the website from where users can switch between desired languages (Arabic, French).  This can be implemented through WPML plugin that has one-time payment for download. And then it can be integrated to the website. 

9)	There are additional pages on the website where news feeds are posted by the admin. Admin posts here the videos and service descriptions provided on the platform, testimonials, tips and FAQs, etc.

10)	Social Media linking will be done to promote the website on other social networking accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. 

11)	Contractors/Providers will pay to increase visibility on the website that will help them to list their profiles as featured listings.
